    <h2>Travis Lanham</h2>
    <p>Hey all! Allow me to introduce myself! I am Travis. I was born in Texas and grew up there. 
        I have since moved to and stayed in Idaho
        where it is not as hot. I have been married for 7 1/2 years now with my wonderful wife and we have 2 kids.
        Mason is 5 and Hyrum is 2.
    </p>
    <p>I am an amatuer Stongman and recently won a local competition that qualified me for nationals.
        I enjoy lifting heavy weights at the gym and the community of strong dedicated people I lift with. I've been lifting for
        3 years now.
    </p>
    <p>I am also a lover of the arts. Specifically of theater. I did theater for 8 years. Then I took a 10 year hiatus.
        I recently participated in Beauty and the Beast and it reignited my love for theater.
        I am currently playing the role of Lurch in "The Addams Family"
