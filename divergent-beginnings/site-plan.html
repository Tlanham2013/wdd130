        Our Purpose
        This is where Divergent Beginnings shines. Divergent Beginnings is a non-profit 
        started and run by mothers of neuro diverse children. They went through the process of getting a 
        diagnosis for their kids. Then they were met with a void. A complete lack of information as to how to proceed. 
        Through Grit and determination they figured out what their kids qualified for and got them enrolled in various 
        programs to help their kids and their families.

        Diagnosis
        Then you take a visit to the doctor. For many people the process to receive a diagnosis can take months. 
        The testing is very thorough and puts the child and the parents through a lot of stress. Finally after months of 
        testing and piles of paperwork you receive a diagnosis. Now your journey is just beginning.

        After a Diagnosis
        What do you do with a diagnosis? What help is available to you? What therapies should your child be in? Do they need 
        eating therapy? Do they need equestrian therapy? Do they need speech therapy? Doctors dont even attempt to answer 
        these questions. It is generally left to the family to decide and then to complete all of the necessary documentation 
        to get into those therapies. This can cause many families to get a diagnosis and then go no further or not to receive
         all of the help that they are qualified for.

      <h3>About Us</h3>
      <p>
        About us
        Divergent Beginnings is the bridge for families with a new diagnosis. Receiving a diagnosis for a family with
         neuro diverse children is a very long process. First you start noticing a few things in your child but you think
          that it is probably just your imagination. Then you start to do some reading about probable causes for their behavior.
           You start to visit online forums and start to think that maybe your child could be on the spectrum.

           About us
            Then they looked back at all of the families and decided that they would reach out a hand to those 
            that would come after them and create something to try to help those families. They created Divergent Beginnings 
            to help create community for families. It can be very scary once you have received a diagnosis for your children. 
            There are some people in the world that don't understand what a child being on the spectrum means for the family. 
            Unfortunately there are even some people that judge those children and their families very harshly.

      <h3>Community Events</h3>
      <p>
        Community Support
        Our goal is to create communities where people can get the support and direction they need to be able to succeed and grow. 


        To make our support groups more convenient and allow more people to attend we will now have our support groups online! Part of these support groups is discussing IEP rights and responsibilities. Helping families to advocate for themselves and for their children.


        Divergent Beginnings also uses its platform to raise awareness for other people in the space and the work they are doing. For example Monthly Highlight! We are still highlighting our friend and owner of Creating Family Harmony, Lindsey Cox. She offers a wide range of services including clinics, CFH Family Program, one on one parenting consults, in-home observations, and seminars. If these would help you in your parenting journey learn more at her website here:
